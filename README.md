# NX-Shell (Deko3D) ![Github latest downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/joel16/NX-Shell/total.svg)

NX Shell is a multi-purpose file manager for the Nintendo Switch that aims towards handling various file types while keeping the basic necessities of a standard file manager. Initially, the project was inspired by LineageOS/CyanogenMod's file manager for android, and even had a similar design approach to that of the famous Android file manager. However, it has been re-written from scratch, now using more up to date tools and libraries.
